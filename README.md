# aoc2015-prolog
My naive Advent of Code 2015 solutions in Prolog

I'll add other soltions once I created them. I just started solving it, since I just learned about Prolog.

## Remarks
I'm using SWI-Prolog locally and since Prolog is something new for me, I'll not care about interop with other interpreters.
Please be aware, that I don't upload the inputs from the riddles.
You can get them from the [home page](https://adventofcode.com/2015).

## Usage
Every day gets a seperate folder with two files, one for each riddle.
If you want to try them on your own, you will need to add the input to a `input.txt` file in the corresponding folder of the day.
Afterwards request `run(X)` in `swipl`. It will show the solution.
